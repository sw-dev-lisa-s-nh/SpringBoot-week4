This is the second week of our final project.   Well into the implementation at this point.
I have completed the following tasks:

(1) Designed the Database

(2) Created a Maven Project

(3) Implemented the Repositories

(4) Implemented the Entities

(5) Implemented the Initial Controllers

(6) Implemented the Initial Services

(7) CRUD Operations Are Implemented for Instruments, Gigs & Users

My tasks for this week are:

(1) Test all implemented functionality

(2) Design the remaining functionality

(3) Start to implement the interaction between users and gigs


Here is the updated plan for my project:

Initial Idea: My idea is to have a website that helps musicians connect with possible events (gigs) 
& additionally have event (gig) planners connect with available musicians.  

Entities:  
1.  user (roles: musician & planner)
2.  address (aspect of location for users and gigs)
3.  instrument
4.  gig
5.  gig_status (connects musicians with gigs)
6.  join table on musician & instrument
7.  join table on gig_status & instruments requested
8.  (FUTURE PLAN):  credentials
9.  (FUTURE PLAN):  Add another role to user:  systemAdmin

           
JoinTables & Relationships Between Tables:
      1.  One to Many: musician to instrument (Each musician might play multiple instruments)
      2.  One to Many:  gig_status to instrument (Each gig_status request might have multiple requested instruments)
      3.  Many to Many :  gig to instrument -- Each instrument can be requested multiple times for a gig (record in gig_status). A gig might request multiple musicians to play the same instruments (gig_status)   A gig might request multiple musicians to play the same instruments (gig_status) multiple version of the same instrument.
